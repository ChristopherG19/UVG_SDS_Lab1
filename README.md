# Phishing Website Classification

This project aimed to develop models for classifying URLs as either phishing or legitimate. The dataset initially contained only URL and 'status' labels, indicating whether a URL was classified as phishing or not. To improve the predictive power of the models, additional features were engineered using 15 custom functions. These features were designed to extract various characteristics from the URLs.

## Feature Engineering

The dataset was enriched with 15 new features generated by custom functions. These features included:
- `length` **(int64)**: Length of the URL string.
- `subdomain` **(int64)**: Number of subdomains in the URL.
- `vowels` **(float64)**: Ratio of vowels to consonants in the URL.
- `paths` **(int64)**: Number of path extensions in the URL.
- `special_char` **(int64)**: Number of special characters in the URL.
- `domain_length` **(int64)**: Length of the domain in the URL.
- `sensitive_keywords` **(int64)**: Count of sensitive keywords in the URL.
- `domain_age` **(int64)**: Age of the domain in days.
- `hyphens` **(int64)**: Number of hyphens and underscores in the URL.
- `suspicious_tld` **(int64)**: Presence of a suspicious top-level domain **(TLD)**.
- `rand_numstring` **(int64)**: Presence of random numeric strings in the URL.
- `https` **(int64)**: Usage of HTTPS protocol in the URL.
- `num_letter_ratio_path` **(float64)**: Ratio of letters to numbers in the URL path.
- `num_letter_ratio_domain` **(float64)**: Ratio of letters in the domain.

## Model Training and Evaluation

Two classification models were trained using the engineered features: a Random Forest classifier and a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. The dataset was split into training, validation, and test sets to train and evaluate the models; those were saved as separate CSV files for further analysis and reproducibility. Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, confusion matrices, ROC curves, and AUC scores were computed for each model to assess their performance in classifying phishing websites.

## Random Forest Model Results

The Random Forest model demonstrated robust performance in classifying websites, achieving an overall accuracy of 85.0%. Precision, recall, and F1-scores for both phishing and legitimate classes hovered around 85%, indicating a balanced performance in predicting both classes. The confusion matrix revealed a relatively even distribution of false positives and false negatives. Additionally, the identical ROC curves for both training and validation sets suggest consistent performance across different test sets, albeit with minimal decimal variations.

## SVM Model Results

The SVM model also performed well in classifying URLs, achieving an overall accuracy of 78.22%. Notably, it showed a high recall of 86% for phishing URLs, indicating its effectiveness in identifying most malicious URLs. However, it exhibited a lower recall of 70% for legitimate URLs, suggesting some room for improvement in identifying normal URLs without sacrificing precision in phishing detection.

In summary, both models showed promising results in classifying phishing websites, with the Random Forest model demonstrating slightly higher accuracy and the SVM model showing a better recall for phishing URLs. Further optimizations may enhance the performance of both models in distinguishing between phishing and legitimate websites.
